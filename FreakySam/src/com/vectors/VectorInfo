Benefits of the dot product
	Aid in perpendicular check
			if A.B = 0, then A and B are perpendicular
	Angle check
	(assuming q is the angle between vectors A and B)	
			if A.B > 0, then q < 90;
			if A.B < 0, then q > 90;
			
			
Benefits of the cross product,
	Returns a vector that is perpendicular to both original vectors.
